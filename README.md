These are my personal python shell scripts for quickly opening searches/message boards. Feel free to modify them as needed.

Copy them to a folder (for instance ~/.pyscripts) and then add the following aliases to your .zshrc or .bashrc

```
alias goog="python ~/.pyscripts/googlescript.py"
alias yout="python ~/.pyscripts/youtubescript.py"
alias reddit="python ~/.pyscripts/redditscript.py"
alias 4chan="python ~/.pyscripts/4chan.py"
```
